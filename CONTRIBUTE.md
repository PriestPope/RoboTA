   we review your contribution and if it's good to merge. GitHub will
   send you email notifications about your PR once any changes are made
   to your PR.

### Git Commit Guidelines
This project has not (yet) enforced a `Commit Message Format`.

But a **more readable messages** in your commit could help us
to review your code, and approve your contribution quicker.

It's also easier for us to locate problems though the project history
later.

Although this project has not (yet) enforced a `Commit Message Format`,
[Git Commit Guidelines - Angular.js](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines)
is a good example and guideline of **more readable commits**
